## üì± How to Play

### Game Modes
1. **Single Player**: Select "Play vs Computer" to challenge the AI
2. **2 Players**: Select "2 Players" to play with a friend

### Game Instructions

#### Rock Paper Scissors
- **Single Player**: Click Rock, Paper, or Scissors to play against the computer
- **2 Players**: Players take turns choosing their weapons
- First to win gets a point, rounds continue until you choose to restart

#### Tic Tac Toe
- Players take turns placing X's and O's on the board
- First player to get 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
- If the board fills up without a winner, it's a draw
- Scores are tracked across multiple games

#### Memory Game

- If you find a match, you get a point and another turn
- If no match, the turn passes to the other player
- Game ends when all pairs are found - highest score wins

## üåê Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
python app.py
```

### Production Deployment

#### Option 1: Heroku
1. Create a `Procfile`:
   ```
   web: gunicorn app:app
   ```

2. Add to requirements.txt:
   ```
   gunicorn==20.1.0
   ```

3. Deploy to Heroku:
   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name
   git push heroku main
   ```

#### Option 2: Python Anywhere
1. Upload files to PythonAnywhere
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure WSGI file to point to `app.py`
4. Set up static files serving

#### Option 3: VPS/Server
1. Install Python and dependencies
2. Use Gunicorn as WSGI server
3. Set up Nginx as reverse proxy
4. Configure SSL certificates

### Environment Variables
For production, set these environment variables:
```bash
export FLASK_ENV=production
export SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret-key
export DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
```

## üîß Configuration

### Database Configuration
The app uses SQLite by default. For production, you can switch to PostgreSQL or MySQL:

```python
# PostgreSQL
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dbname'

# MySQL
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql://user:pass@localhost/dbname'
```

### Security Settings
- Change the `SECRET_KEY` in production
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Add CSRF protection for forms

## üé® Customization

You can easily customize the games by:
- Changing colors in `static/css/styles.css`
- Adding new symbols to the Memory Game
- Modifying game logic in `static/js/script.js`
- Adding new games by extending the existing structure
- Adjusting animation timings and effects
- Adding new API endpoints in `app.py`

3. **Port Conflicts**: Change the port in `app.py` if 5000 is busy
4. **Static Files**: Ensure the static folder structure is correct

### Debug Mode
For development, enable debug mode:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```
